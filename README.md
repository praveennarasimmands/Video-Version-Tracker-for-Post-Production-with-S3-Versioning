# **Video Version Tracker for Post-Production with S3 Versioning**

## **Domain**: Media & Entertainment

### **Problem Statement**
Video production teams often work with multiple versions of video files, including raw footage, edited clips, and final cuts. Without a proper system, tracking which version is the latest or accessing earlier versions can become challenging and inefficient. This may lead to confusion and time wasted searching for the right file.

### **Challenges**
- **Multiple Versions**: Production teams may have many drafts of video files, leading to confusion if there’s no clear system for tracking them.
- **Risk of Using Outdated Versions**: Without proper versioning, the team might accidentally use an outdated or incomplete version of a video.
- **Inefficient Search for Video Versions**: Manually locating previous versions of video files can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

### **Solution Overview**
By implementing **S3 Versioning**, we can track and store every version of video files (raw footage, edited clips, final cuts). This ensures the latest version is always easily accessible, while also allowing for quick retrieval of older versions whenever needed.

### **How It Solves the Problem**
S3 Versioning makes it easy to track, manage, and retrieve video versions. It helps production teams identify the most recent version, easily compare revisions, and access older edits to prevent mistakes and save time.

## **How We Will Solve the Problems**

1. **Enable S3 Versioning for Video Files**: Store video files in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, automatically managing the versions.
2. **Track and Store Video Edits**: Every time a video file is edited or modified, S3 will create a new version.
3. **Provide Tools for Comparison and Retrieval**: Build tools for the production team to easily compare video versions, review changes, and fetch older versions.

## **Features**
- **Version Control for Video Files**: Every video file is tracked, and updates automatically create new versions, ensuring no data is lost.
- **Video Version Comparison**: Tools to compare different versions of video files, helping teams track the evolution of edits.
- **Easy Retrieval of Video Versions**: Teams can access any version of a video quickly, whether it’s the latest edit or an earlier cut.

## **How It Works**

1. **Store Videos in S3**: All video files (raw footage, edits, final cuts) are uploaded to an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
2. **Track Changes Automatically**: Every update or change to a video file is stored as a new version in the S3 bucket, making it easy to track revisions.
3. **Manage Versions**: A user-friendly interface allows team members to compare versions, identify differences, and access specific versions of video files as needed.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-version-tracker.git
cd video-version-tracker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: Enable S3 Versioning**

Run the `enable_versioning.py` script to enable versioning on your S3 bucket.

```bash
python enable_versioning.py
```

### **Step 3: Upload Video**

To upload a video file, use the `upload_video.py` script. This will upload the video and store metadata like version details and timestamps.

```bash
python upload_video.py
```

### **Step 4: List and Compare Video Versions**

Use the `list_versions.py` script to list all versions of a video file and compare them.

```bash
python list_versions.py
```

### **Step 5: Retrieve Specific Version**

To retrieve a specific version of a video file, run the `get_specific_version.py` script with the desired VersionId.

```bash
python get_specific_version.py
```

## **Further Improvements**
- **Integration with Video Editing Software**: Integrate with video editing tools to automatically sync versions and make the comparison process smoother.
- **Automated Comparison**: Implement AI-based comparison tools to highlight differences between video versions automatically, such as changes in scenes or edits.

---

## **Conclusion**
The **Video Version Tracker for Post-Production** with S3 Versioning improves the video production workflow by ensuring that all versions of video files are stored, tracked, and easily accessible. This system eliminates confusion about which version is the latest and ensures that production teams can compare different cuts or retrieve any previous version with ease.
